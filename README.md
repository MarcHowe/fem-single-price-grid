## My process

I started by reading the README file and viewing the images of the desired page. I thought about the three areas 'Join our community', 'Monthy Subscription' and 'Why Us' and how they'll need to move along with the responsive design. I had viewed a recent YouTube video where Flexbox was used and decided to research this as I was building the structure in html. Once this was complete, I focused on the styling, fonts and colours (not noticing the style-guide I will admit) and finally the button and final small touches. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Validated with

- https://validator.w3.org

### What I learned

This was my first challenge after many years away from learning a little bit of html, css and javascript, and I stumbled across this watching a few YouTube video's by [CoderCoder](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder). 

Jump-starting the old brain cells, I was able to remember or quickly research basic html tags to get the right elements together, but I needed to research Flexbox and CSS Grid a little, which allowed me to create the responsive requirements. 
I had a little trouble with the button which actually brought me to media queries - perhaps I could have used this earlier - but enabled me to create the button hover affect only when the browser width has been adjusted to something larger than a mobile device. 
I instintively started to develop desktop first, rather than mobile first but realised soon after and changed my approach. 
Finally, once I had learnt how to upload to my GitHub repository and publish to Cloudflare Pages, I ran the site through a w3.org validator which alerted me to a couple of typo's I hadn't seen and another error, related to the fact I had nested a <button> inside an <a>, which is not valid html, even though it works fine, and the recommendation is to wrap a <form> around <button> instead. 

All in it took two full evenings, including setting up VS Code, GitHub, re-learning Git and publishing the challenge. 

### Continued development

This was an interesting personal challenge and I'm looking forward to the next challenge on html and css before stepping into Javascript (once again).

### Useful resources

- [CoderCoder](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder) - Great resource for learning front-end webdev, put me onto this challenge and will no doubt view more of her content soon. 
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6393827/can-i-nest-a-button-element-inside-an-a-using-html5) - This specific resource helped me with the button link not being compliant, but used several other times when looking for answers. 
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Great guide on Flexbox
- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp) - Useful information on styling buttons, and other CSS information was viewed on this site for the project.
